# Decision support system Project

## Overview
This project is divided into three main parts and focuses on building, manipulating, and analyzing data using SQL Server, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX). The project covers creating and populating databases, performing client-side computations with SSIS, and answering business questions using a datacube model.

## Part 1: Database Creation and Operations
In Part 1, we build the foundation of the project by creating and populating a database using several input files. The steps involve:

- Designing a database schema based on provided data files.
- Importing data from these files into the created tables.
- Performing essential database operations such as data cleaning, transformation, and ensuring data integrity.

### Tools Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)**

## Part 2: Solving Problems using SSIS
In Part 2, the task is to solve a set of problems using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) without writing SQL queries. Instead, we focus on client-side computations using SSIS nodes. This part is specific to each group's assignments and involves creating SSIS packages to meet the problem requirements.

### Key Features:
- Use of SSIS nodes to perform data transformation and computation.
- Integration of multiple data sources to solve assigned problems.

### Tools Used
- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**


## Part 3: Datacube and MDX Queries
In Part 3, we explore analytical operations on the database created in Part 1 by building a datacube and answering business questions using MDX. The steps involved include:

- Designing and implementing a datacube from the relational database.
- Documenting the process of creating the datacube.
- Solving specific business questions using MDX queries in SQL Server Management Studio.

### Key Features:
- Creation of a datacube for efficient data analysis.
- Use of MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) to query the datacube.
- Detailed documentation of the datacube design.

### Tools Used:
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **MDX querying**
